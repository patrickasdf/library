Library project utilising javascript objects to store books as arrays with unique id.
Functionality for adding "new book" via form, deleting books, toggle for read/unread.

*other projects for library are using css colours or styling for read/unread toggle. not functional at this point via JS. css styling would be as in etch-a-sketch etc. not implemented for now. possibly revisit project to implement via JS if possible, otherwise on hiatus for now.
